      "\n",
      "This Reddit post is about a subreddit called r/contagiouslaughter, which has 4.5 million subscribers and is one of the top hundred subreddits. It is a feed of people laughing, with dozens of posts every day. The post also mentions interesting facts about the subreddit.\n",

      "\n",
      "This person has noticed a trend on TikTok where someone will say they can make someone happier in 10 seconds and then there is a duet of people repeating \"Ha\". They also noticed that a subreddit they hadn't heard of before seems to be growing faster recently.\n",
      "\n",
      " Two people start laughing uncontrollably, not because something funny happened, but because they intentionally started laughing. The laughter is so contagious that it builds up to a point where both people are laughing uncontrollably.\n",
      "\n",
      " The speaker was watching a podcast and noticed that one of the hosts would crack a joke, but the other hosts would not laugh or \"sell the joke\". The speaker is considering two ways to approach this issue.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "When creating a podcast, it is important to be aware of the audio track being used as it can make the podcast choppy. Additionally, when someone else sells your joke, it can change the vibe of the podcast.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "This passage discusses the importance of being expressive and enthusiastic when selling someone else's product. It suggests that one should react with enthusiasm and laughter to make the product more appealing. It also suggests that one should be able to accurately estimate the number of people who have purchased the product in order to give the other person an \"assist\" in selling it.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker recounts a funny story involving Orlando Bloom that was made even funnier by the laughter of their friend Sam. The speaker considers it one of the top five funniest moments in their first million history.\n",

      "\n",
      " Lex Friedman is a successful podcaster who speaks in a monotone, calm manner. This disproves the theory that one needs to be a bit \"screw loose\" to be successful in podcasting. However, it is suggested that those who are very stable and smart may be at a disadvantage.\n",

      "When asking questions, it is important to ask the real questions that people want to hear, such as how much they make, what keeps them up at night, and when they have failed. Asking these questions can be like a \"get out of jail free card\" and will help you stand out from the crowd.\n",

      "People have become fascinated with the idea of cheating in various activities, such as poker and fishing, even though it has been happening for a long time. There have been controversies surrounding the idea of cheating, such as the one involving Carlson, and the one involving stuffing fish with lead balls. The speaker has a few ideas about this topic.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker finds something seductive about cheating scandals, and is drawn to them even though they don't normally follow chess. They are willing to spend time researching the scandals, as it is a better entry point than simply praising the person involved.\n",
      "\n",
      " Dana White, president of the UFC, believes that the UFC will become huge because people are already playing sports like basketball and football in parks and playgrounds. He believes that the UFC will be the next big thing. The recent match was a great example of this.\n",

      "\n",
      "The speaker's thesis is that the UFC will become a successful global sport because people are naturally drawn to fights, regardless of their interest in the sport. This has proven to be true, as the UFC has become a multi-billion dollar company.\n",
      "\n",
      " Fighting is popular in many countries, including China and Russia, and controversy can also draw in viewers. For example, chess became more interesting when a scandal was discovered, prompting people to look into the evidence.\n",
      "\n",
      " This discussion focuses on the concept of cheating in chess, both online and in person. It compares the idea to the movie Ocean's 11, as it is a question of how someone could cheat in a physical setting. It also mentions the case of a chess player who was caught cheating online, and how AI can be used to cheat in online chess.\n",

      "Magnus believes that Hans has cheated, but he does not know how. He has not been able to provide any details as to why he believes this, leading some to question if it is just sour grapes. Magnus does not know how Hans cheated, so he has not been able to provide any evidence.\n",
      "\n",
      " A player was surprised to be beaten by an opponent who didn't seem to be trying very hard. Upon further investigation, it was revealed that the opponent had a history of playing well and had ranked up in the past.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "This article discusses the rise of a great chess player to a grandmaster level, and how they use a chess solver engine to measure how close to perfect their moves are. The greatest players of all time have achieved a 62-72% match rate with the AI's perfect moves, and the player in question has had several games with a high match rate.\n",
      "\n",
      " This discussion is about a chess player who is making 100% game theory optimal moves, which is unusual as the greatest players ever are only at 70%. There is evidence that suggests he may be cheating, but nobody knows for sure. The speaker used to play chess competitively as a kid.\n",
      "\n",
      " This argument suggests that playing chess can burn a lot of calories, and raises the question of how to prove if someone is cheating while playing.\n",
      "\n",
      " This discussion is about how to prove someone has cheated in a game, and how the governing bodies of the game can prevent cheating in the future. Suggestions include using metal detectors, but it is unclear how effective this would be.\n",

      " Cheating is possible in the Olympics, as athletes can test clean and break records, only to be caught later when the testing agencies update their tests to detect new substances.\n",
      "\n",
      " This article discusses the problem of cheating in high level sports, such as the Olympics, and how it is a cat and mouse game between cheaters and anti-cheaters. It also looks at the anti-cheating business category and how the author was unaware of it until they started building a startup in the gaming industry.\n",

      "\n",
      "This company was acquired by Twitch and while building in this space, they would play games in the office such as Fortnite, Overwatch, and more. Through this, they realized the importance of hand-eye coordination and aim in these games, and the ability to shoot accurately.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "This passage discusses the use of aim bots in video games, which are pieces of software that allow players to aim and shoot with perfect accuracy. This ruins the game for other players, so video games have anti-cheat mechanisms built in to prevent cheating.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The gaming world has developed a competitive scene, esports, and has had to figure out how to catch cheaters. Offline games have to learn from the gaming world about anti-cheat software, as there are companies that specialize in this.\n",
      "\n",
      " Anti-cheat providers are necessary for games as they provide a security system that can stop potential forms of cheating. These companies become customers of each game and act as anti-cheat software. This is the only way to ensure competitive security.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The increased attention on chess, poker, and other games has led to a need for increased integrity in the games. This is seen as a positive development, although there are conspiracy theories that suggest chess.com and other organizations are working together to hype up chess.\n",
      "\n",
      " This conversation discusses the concept of cheating in sports, and how it has been overlooked in some in-person sports. It suggests that measures need to be put in place to prevent cheating, and one idea is mentioned.\n",
      "\n",
      " Peter, founder of Nomad List, has been featured on a podcast before. To prevent competitors from copying his data, he would add fake data to his list, such as a city called Dorabo. This was done as a way to protect his company from being copied.\n",
      "\n",
      " The speaker is considering how a data set they enjoyed could be applied to anti-cheating measures in chess, such as introducing incorrect moves that would catch cheaters. They are wondering what other tricks could be used to prevent cheating.\n",
      "\n",
      " Elon Musk was asked on Twitter how he found the person who was leaking internal company data to news outlets in 2008. He responded with an explanation of the measures he took to find the culprit.\n",
      "\n",
      " Elon Musk sent a unique email to everyone in his company, with one small difference in the text. This created a unique fingerprint for each person, allowing them to be identified.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "A false piece of information was used to quickly catch the person responsible for an email leak. This was done instead of going through all the email servers and patting people down as they left the factory. The false information was used to draw out the person responsible.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker is discussing the implications of cheating in gaming and how anti-cheating measures have historically been unable to keep up with the cheaters. They are interested to see how this progresses and who will win in the end.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The larger the amount of money involved, the greater the incentive to cheat. This is why companies like PayPal and Facebook have dedicated staff to catch cheaters. Bitcoin is attractive to people because of the large amount of money involved and the potential for hacking, spoofing, and double spending.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "This is a discussion about the security of a large sum of money, estimated to be around half a trillion dollars. It is argued that the absence of a hack is a sign of the security of the money, and that there is an incentive to cheat when there is a lot of money involved. An example of this is a high stakes poker game in LA that is streamed.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "This story is about a game similar to poker, where players have hundreds of thousands of dollars on the table. One woman plays a hand with jack four offsuits in a way that makes no sense, resulting in a pot of half a million dollars. The game is streamed on a Twitch channel.\n",
      "\n",
      " A player calls all in with nothing on the board, which has no jacks or fours and a flush and straight draw. People are shocked by the call, but the player wins the hand. It is suggested that the player may have misread their cards.\n",
      "\n",
      " A woman bluffs her opponent in a card game, catching his bluff and surprising him with her play. He is initially shocked, but then realizes she caught his bluff with a play that makes no sense.\n",

      "\n",
      "A person at a table is stone-faced for a minute and a half, seemingly trying to figure out how the other person could have made an anomalous move that could only be explained as cheating. The person's brain is trying to process the situation, but can't come up with an explanation.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "A person made a large bet on a card game, prompting an investigation. Reddit and YouTube users conducted a crowdsourced investigation to find out what happened, similar to how they found the Boston bomber.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "It is believed that a member of the production team was feeding a contestant information during a game show, and that the contestant had a vibrator device in her pocket that would signal her when to call a bet.\n",
      "\n",
      " This is a discussion about a hacker conference that happens every year in Vegas, called Defcon. It is the number one hacker convention and it is unclear why anyone would attend.\n",
      "\n",
      " This conversation highlights how much of hacking is not necessarily complex computer engineering, but rather someone calling and asking for personal information such as a mother's maiden name, date of birth, and last four digits of a social security number.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "This is an example of \"human engineering\" or \"catfishing\" where someone calls a bank and pretends to be the account holder, providing the security question answer and last four digits of the account number to get the password changed and access the account.\n",
      "\n",
      " Sim swapping is a common way of hacking people, where a hacker tricks a person into giving up their password, allowing them to access their accounts without having to break in. This is done by impersonating the person and asking for a new SIM card from a service provider.\"\n",

      " This discussion is about the ease of appearing to be an expert in something due to the prevalence of social media. It is suggested that someone with no marketing experience can look up Wikipedia articles and tweet threads on the topic, and people who don't know any better may think they are an expert.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      " This is a creative way of presenting a resume, where the person's skills and interests are presented in the form of a Mario game. As the player progresses through the levels, they learn more about the person and at the end of the game, they can contact the person for work.\n",

      " Kirin, a Japanese company, has partnered with a university to create bowls and chopsticks that use a weak electrical current to make food taste saltier. This technology could help people reduce their salt intake while still enjoying the taste of their food.\n",
      "\n",
      " Scientists have found a way to make food taste salty without using as much sodium, and a company called Air Up has created a scented ring around a product to give it a smell.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Researchers found a way to make food taste better without changing its chemical composition, by using scent instead of electrical current. They raised 68 million dollars and are now making over a hundred million a year.\n",
      "\n",
      " Air Up is a flavored ring that is placed on a bottle of water, giving the water a hint of flavor when it is consumed. Glimpse raised a lot of money for the product, but the exact amount is unknown.\n",
      "\n",
      " The speaker is discussing a revenue number and two products they have not tried yet, a chopstick bowl and air up. They are fascinated by the idea of a salty bowl with no extra salt added.\n",

It also looks at the concept of \"human engineering\" or \"catfishing\" and how hackers can use this to gain access to accounts. Finally, it looks at the Defcon hacker conference and how much of hacking is not necessarily complex computer engineering, but rather someone calling and asking for personal information.\n",
